# Wheel of Fortune

A small game project for my Brother-in-Law from back in 2012, experimenting with a web sockets, multiple devices (Web + iPad) and lasting marriages :).

Unfortuntely this isn't the final version we used and I cannot find that final codebase anywhere :(
The game play in this state is fragmented, but some elements work.

### To Run

`npm install` then `node app.js` to launch the server (configed to port 80).
