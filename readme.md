# Wheel of Fortune

A small game project for my Brother-in-Law from back in 2012, experimenting with a web sockets, multiple devices (Web + iPad) and lasting marriages :)

### To Run

#### Server

Just run `node app.js` to launch to server-side part of the project.

#### Client

This needs an iPad and Web to run, as the iPad serves as the control panel for the game.
Open the `index.html` file on the iPad and as many connected browsers as you want, should get things up and running.
